# ML-DL-Xperiments
ML & DL are the tools for the revolution in AI. Its requirements are to understand sophisticated mathematics and programming. Pre-build libraries give us the best result but to understand the functionality of these libraries, one has to jump in math and coding. 

In this project, I am trying to implement the basic level of ML like  _y=mx+c_ and develop my understanding of how the basics work.

As well as playing the inbuilt data provided by different Python libraries. I think this will help to understand the core functionality of AI. Later, I am planning to play with the real data.
